# My Framework
My Framework is a custom framework that is based on XML. It is capable of rendering very specific HTML elements for the BrytBoy suite of classes via custom tags with traditional XML syntax.

# Creating a BrytBoy Element
An example of a basic BrytBoy element generation might look as follows:
`<brytboy name="test"></brytboy>`

The various metadata that can be included in a BrytBoy element tag include:
- name: a String representing the BrytBoy element's name
- height: a Number representing the height of the BrytBoy element
- width: a Number representing the width of the BrytBoy element
- language: a String representing the BrytBoy element's programming language
- available: a Boolean representing whether the BrytBoy element is available to handle work
